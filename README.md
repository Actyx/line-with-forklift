# Actyx Demo

## Case

Control a production line composed of
- a machine producing parts
- a robot picking up and packaging parts
- a forklift picking up package parts

## How to run

Start Actyx on your computer, and then
- start the dashboard `npm run dashboard`
- start the machine `npm run start machine`
- start the robot `npm run start robot`
- start the forklift `npm run forklift`

If you want to see these working on multiple nodes,
just start Actyx on another computer and run one of
the programs there. It will all synchronize!
